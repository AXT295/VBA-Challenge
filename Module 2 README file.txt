Module 2 Challenge
Due Date: 09/18/2023 Monday 11:59PM

This module challenge was to be able to take a large data set and creating a script to loop through all the stocks for one year with the;
-The ticker symbol
-What the yearly change from the beginning price when it opened to the closing price at the end of the year
-Total stock volume

I have added comments throughout the script to explain what was going on

The script loops through one year of stock data and reads the ticker symbol, volume of stock, the opening and closing price

Also applying conditional formatting for the yearly change column and percent change column

While also creating a script that will calculate what the greatest percent increase & decrease, with the greatest total volume

Then attaching all three requirements such as the screeshot of the results, separate VBA script file, and the README file onto the gitub repository.

With the help of this script that I have found on the website(https://github.com/shrawantee/VBA-Scripting---Stock-Market-Analysis/blob/master/HW2_Hard_DS.vbs), with my uncle's help who has background in coding, and reaching out to my peers in slack on the #02-ask-the-class channel, I have come up with the script that matches the final result in our module 2 homework. I did run into a problem where I was unable to run the code at the same time for each data sheet.
